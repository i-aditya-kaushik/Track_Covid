The project gave me many insights into the cv2 and tesseract library. I had to try and retry many different things to make sure that the processed image should look authentic. Even though I had used selenium before, the project brushed up my knowledge and also allowed me to have a deep dive into some concepts which I had not explored before. This project also made me learn about Ps, which I intended to learn at some point and now, I wonâ€™t hesitate to design my own thing!
